# House Price Prediction

A simple machine learning project that predicts house prices using the UGS housing dataset.


This project aims to build a regression model that can predict the price of a house based on features like:

- Average number of rooms per dwelling
- Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- Other relevant attributes (as provided in the dataset)

The model is trained on the UGS housing data and evaluated using standard metrics.
